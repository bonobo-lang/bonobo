MonkeyBusiness is the new frontend for the Bonobo language.
It is written in Java, and aims to be a foundation for solid tooling
around the language.

The MonkeyBusiness compiler, otherwise known as `bonobo`,
generates LLVM IR, and therefore can be used to produce outputs
for a variety of targets:
* Desktop and server computers (multiple architectures)
* WebAssembly
* Many more...

Ultimately, MonkeyBusiness will replace the old Dart implementation.
