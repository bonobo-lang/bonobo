// Bonobo has very strong static typing.
// This makes it possible to infer the type of many,
// if not all expressions and parameters.
//
// In practice, you will usually not have to even provide
// type annotations.

// Bonobo automatically recognizes the return type to be `Num`.
f someNum(a: Num, b: Num) => 24.0

// Bonobo can also infer the types of parameters.
f someOtherNum(a) => someNum(1, 35))
