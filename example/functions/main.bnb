// A brief explanation of functions in Bonobo...
fn main => print(emoji())

// You can explicitly declare the return type of functions.
fn one: Num => 1

// However, you can also omit the declaration.
//
// The return type will be inferred.
fn two => 2

// Functions can also have parameters.
//
// Functions can be annotated with types.
fn add(a, b: Num) => b

// Functions don't have to be lambdas, of course.
