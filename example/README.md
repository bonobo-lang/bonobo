# Bonobo Examples
This is a well-documented set of examples of the Bonobo language.

Combined with the [language specification](https://github.com/bonobo-lang/bonobo/blob/master/spec/README.md),
this is a great way to quickly Bonobo's syntax and semantics.

To serve the `example` documentation for viewing in a Web browser, simply run the following in your shell
or command prompt:

```bash
# Replace `bonobo/example` with the path to your
# Bonobo installation's `example/` directory.
cd bonobo/example
bonobo document
```
