// Use a tuple to define a type composed of an ordered series of types.
//
// Tuples are intended for *ordered* series.
type Point = (Int, Int)

// The parentheses are unnecessary.
type StringAndLength = String, Int

// For an un-ordered composite type, stick to a struct type:
type Rectangle {
  location: Point
  left: Int
  top: Int
  width: Int
  height: Int
}
